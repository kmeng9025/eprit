    % In a real implementation, this would involve:
    % 1. Defining the model architecture (e.g., a neural network).
    % 2. Setting up the training environment (e.g., with TensorFlow or PyTorch).
    % 3. Preprocessing the training data and annotated ROIs.
    % 4. Training the model using a suitable optimization algorithm.
    % 5. Evaluating the model's performance.
    % 6. Saving the trained model.

    % For now, we'll just return a dummy model.
