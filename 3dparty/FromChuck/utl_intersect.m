% finds intersections of a line with a polygon.  returns parametric

        % so at this point, crossproj(i) and (i+1) differ in sign.  It goes
        % to zero somewhere in between, which is our intersection point
        % (where the projection of a point on the contour edge lies right
        % on our line).  just need to move the right distance along the
        % edge.
        % regardless whether crossproj(i) is positive or negative, we want
        % to know the fraction of the distance from i to i+1 it accounts
        % for.  Can get this by taking absolute value of the ratio.  Note
        % that if we didn't do this, we could end up with a negative
        % fraction which would be incorrect.
