# Enter The dosimetry and description information
# for a specific collimator ("Single") or "Multiple"
# collimators if interpolation is allowed.  
#
# Note anything after a pound "#" sign is a comment
# and not read.
# Note also "#" MUST be present on blank lines.
#
# First enter type of collimator (Circular/Rectangular)
#
Circular
#
# Next enter if this is for a single collimator or 
# multiple collimators (Single/Multiple)
#
Multiple
#
# Enter tube potential (kVp) at which dosimetry was done.
#
kVp=225
#
# Enter tube current (mA) at which dosimetry was done.
#
mA=13
#
# Enter filter used to do dosimetry.
#
Filter=0.3mm Cu Filter
#
# Enter depths at which dosimetry was done for this collimator.
# Depths:
0	0.2	0.4	0.9	1.4	1.9	2.4	3.4  4.4  5.4
#
# Enter field size(s) at which dose information was done.  
# "Single" - enter z,x dimensions (eg. 2.2    1.1)
# "Multiple" - enter field sizes (1 number, radii of field size
# (eg. 8.7    4.4    4    2.8    2.2    1.8)
#
3.5 2.5 1.85 1.5 0.75 0.5
#
# Next enter dose rates.  
# "Single" - will be one column
# "Multiple" - will be one column/field sizes entered above
